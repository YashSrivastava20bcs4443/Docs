I would like to highlight a couple of points:

Wincollect Status: We've noticed that Wincollect is not running on many servers, even after manual attempts. This has been identified as a constraint and is reflected in the status.

NTP Output: The required output for NTP has not been received yet, as per the team's assessment. We will discuss and resolve this with Pardeep sir.
