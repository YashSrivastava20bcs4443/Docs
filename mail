Subject: Urgent Request for Manual Server Hygiene Check

Dear [Recipient],

We have successfully tested our Windows server hygiene script for the specified DMZ server (details attached in this email). However, the script has not yet been tested for the remaining servers in other domains. Due to the urgency of this task, we request that you manually check the hygiene for these Windows servers (list attached).

For the Linux servers, as the Ansible script could not be tested due to environmental constraints, please conduct the hygiene checks manually as well.

The automated report for the DMZ server has been escalated to EMS via email.

Thank you for your prompt attention.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
