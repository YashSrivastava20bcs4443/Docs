Subject: Centralized Windows Server for Server Hygiene Check Automation

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

We are currently working on automating the server hygiene check process, and for that, we require a centralized Windows server where we can run our script via a pipeline. Could you please confirm if there is a centralized server available within our infrastructure that has the necessary access and is reachable to all the Windows servers we are targeting? Additionally, it should support Invoke-Command for running remote scripts.

If such a server exists, kindly provide the necessary details or help us set up the required configuration.

Your assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
