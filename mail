Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I accidentally missed punching out from the ESS platform on May 6th, 2024. My actual punch-in time was at [Your Punch-in Time], and I left the office at 8:24 PM. However, due to a power outage at home, I continued working remotely until 10:00 PM and unfortunately, forgot to clock out before the system went offline.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. To ensure accurate timekeeping, I kindly request your approval to adjust my punch out time to reflect my actual work hours, which is 10:00 PM on May 6th, 2024.

For your reference, I have attached any documentation available to support my working hours that evening (e.g., emails sent/received after 8:24 PM).

Thank you for your understanding.
