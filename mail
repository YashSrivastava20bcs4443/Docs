Subject: Request to Create Service Account for Network Automation - Switch Backup

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of the Network Automation Project, we had previously created a service account on the firewalls for backup automation purposes. We are now entering the second phase of the project, which involves automating backups for the network switches.

In order to proceed with this phase, we request the creation of a service account on the switches as well, specifically for backup automation tasks. The account should have the necessary permissions to ensure smooth operation and access for the automation scripts.

Please let us know once the service account is created so we can proceed with the required configurations.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
Yash
Network Automation Team
