Subject: Firewall Backup Status and Routing Request

Hi Rajiv,

I wanted to update you on the current firewall backup status. Out of our 11 sites, we are successfully taking backups for the following 6 sites: LI, LV, Canada, Pune, GCR, and OKR.

However, for NJDC, Mexico, and New York, we are able to reach them from our centralized server at 10.7.35.251, but backups are not being taken.

Could you please check the routing for these sites and make the necessary adjustments?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
