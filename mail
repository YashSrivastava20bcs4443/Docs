Subject: Request for Manual Execution of Compliance Checks Due to Ansible Dependency

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that the current Ansible script I have prepared for the compliance checks will not function on all servers as Ansible is not installed across the environment, and it is a required dependency for the script.

In light of this, I suggest proceeding with the manual execution of commands on the servers for now. I am currently working on optimizing the script, and if I am able to develop a more suitable version, I will provide it by tomorrow for testing. In the meantime, please advise on how you would like to move forward.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
