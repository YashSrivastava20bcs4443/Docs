Hi [Senior's Name],

I wanted to update you on the current status of the automation process for compliance checks.

Windows Automation:

Currently, no centralized server has full reachability to all other servers in the infrastructure.

We need to determine how many servers, according to their respective domains, can invoke other servers.

Initial tests on a Windows server confirm the script is working and generating reports correctly.


Linux Automation:

The Ansible script is written but not yet tested due to the unavailability of local services for credential provision.

Staging environment: Only limited servers have full access to other servers, and thereâ€™s a policy controlling this access.


Validation:

We need a manually generated or external report to validate the accuracy of the automated reports.



Considering the challenges above, I will require more time to:

Complete the pipeline implementation.

Identify the servers with full reachability in our environment.


Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
