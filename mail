Subject: Consolidated List of Linux and Windows Instances

Hi Hamed,

Thank you for the update.

Please find attached the consolidated list of Linux and Windows instances along with status comments and any identified constraints. As noted, all the items have been closed, and the only pending task is the hygiene check. We are on track for the final internal review with Infosec on Thursday.

@Lovekesh Singh and the team, please plan accordingly for the non-scanned servers.

Let me know if you need any further information.

Thanks,
Yash Srivastava
