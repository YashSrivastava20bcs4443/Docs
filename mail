**Subject:** Attendance Correction for Today

Hi [HR's Name],

I made a mistake with my attendance today—I accidentally punched out instead of punching in this morning. Could you please correct this and consider it as my punch-in?

I've already informed my manager, [Manager's Name], about the error, and they’re okay with it. Please feel free to get their approval if needed.

Thanks for your help in sorting this out!

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
