**Subject:** Request for Azure AD Application Configuration for Cost Management API Access for Grafana Project

**Dear [Manager's Name],**

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request the configuration of an Azure Active Directory (AD) application to enable access to the Azure Cost Management API. This is essential for our ongoing project that involves Azure cost analysis using Grafana.

The configuration involves the following steps:

1. **Register an Application in Azure AD:**
   - Navigate to the Azure Portal, and go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations** > **New registration**.
   - Enter a name for the application, select the supported account types, and click "Register."
   - Note down the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**.
   - Under "Certificates & secrets," create a new client secret and store it securely.

2. **Assign API Permissions:**
   - In the Azure AD App, go to **API permissions** > **Add a permission**.
   - Choose **Azure Service Management** > **Delegated permissions** and select the **user_impersonation** permission.
   - Grant admin consent for the permission.

3. **Grant Access to Cost Management Data:**
   - Go to **Azure Portal** > **Subscriptions** > Select the relevant subscription > **Access control (IAM)**.
   - Assign the **Cost Management Reader** role to the Azure AD App.

This configuration is crucial for integrating the Azure Cost Management API with Grafana, allowing us to efficiently monitor and analyze our cloud expenditures.

Please let me know if there are any prerequisites we need to fulfill or if you need further information.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
