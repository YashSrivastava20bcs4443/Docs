Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to bring to your attention that I worked on the weekend of 27th and 28th July as part of the Dr. Drill project, and I had duly punched in for those days. As per our policy, I would like to request compensatory off for 30th September and 1st October, 2024.

Kindly approve this request so that I can forward it to HR for further processing.

Thank you for your consideration and support.
