Document: Automating FortiGate Firewall Backup with Ansible
Overview
This document outlines the process of automating the backup of FortiGate firewall configurations using an Ansible playbook. The playbook will create a backup directory for each firewall (if it doesn't exist), back up the configuration locally, create a corresponding directory on an SFTP server, transfer the backups to the SFTP server, and delete the local backups.

Prerequisites
Ansible Installation: Ensure Ansible is installed on your control machine.
SSH Access: Ensure SSH access is configured for both the FortiGate firewall and the SFTP server.
Dedicated SFTP Server: A dedicated SFTP server should be set up to store backups of network devices.
Python Libraries: The paramiko library should be installed if using SFTP.
Setup Steps
Project Directory Structure:

Create a directory structure for your Ansible project.
Include directories for playbooks, inventory files, roles, and any necessary variables and templates.
Inventory File:

Create an inventory file to define the host details for the FortiGate firewall and the SFTP server.
Include the IP addresses and SSH credentials for these devices.
Variables File:

Define necessary variables such as the local backup directory path, the SFTP server backup directory path, and the firewall name.
Ansible Playbook:

Develop an Ansible playbook to automate the following tasks:
Ensure a local backup directory exists for each firewall.
Back up the FortiGate configuration locally.
Ensure a corresponding directory exists on the SFTP server.
Transfer the local backups to the SFTP server.
Delete the local backups.
Role Tasks:

Define detailed tasks within an Ansible role to handle directory creation, configuration backup, file transfer, and cleanup operations.
Execution
Running the Playbook:
Use the ansible-playbook command to execute the playbook, specifying the inventory file and playbook path.
Monitor the output to ensure each task completes successfully.
Conclusion
Following these steps ensures that FortiGate firewall configurations are backed up in an automated and reliable manner. This setup can be customized further to fit specific environment requirements and security policies.
