Subject: Request for Remote Access to Linux System for Network Automation Testing

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to request remote access to our Linux system. I need to test and run a network automation Ansible script. Unfortunately, after leaving the office network, I am unable to connect to the Linux server from my laptop.

Could you please assist in setting up remote access or provide an alternative solution so that I can continue my work from outside the office?

Thank you for your assistance.
