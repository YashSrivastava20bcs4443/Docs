## **Handling Passwords with Azure Key Vault**

### **Introduction**

Azure Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. This document describes how to add secrets to an existing Azure Key Vault and retrieve them in an Azure DevOps pipeline. This password management process is specifically designed for machine-to-machine operations, ensuring secure and automated access without human intervention.

### **1. Adding Secrets to Azure Key Vault**

1. **Navigate to the Key Vault:**
   - Log in to the Azure portal.
   - Go to **All services** and search for **Key Vaults**.
   - Select your existing Key Vault.

2. **Add a New Secret:**
   - In the Key Vault, navigate to the **Secrets** section.
   - Click on **Generate/Import**.
   - Enter the **Name** for the secret (e.g., `network-device-password`).
   - Enter the **Value** for the secret (e.g., the password you want to store).
   - Click **Create**.

### **2. Configuring Azure DevOps Pipeline to Use Key Vault Secrets**

1. **Create or Edit Your Pipeline:**
   - In Azure DevOps, go to your project.
   - Navigate to the **Pipelines** section.
   - Create a new pipeline or edit an existing one.

2. **Add Azure Key Vault Task:**
   - In your pipeline YAML file, add a task to retrieve secrets from Azure Key Vault. Ensure your pipeline has access to the Key Vault through a service connection.
   - Example YAML snippet:
     ```yaml
     stages:
     - stage: Deploy
       jobs:
       - job: DeployJob
         steps:
         - task: AzureKeyVault@2
           inputs:
             azureSubscription: '<Your Service Connection Name>'
             KeyVaultName: '<Your Key Vault Name>'
             SecretsFilter: '*'
             RunAsPreJob: true
     ```

3. **Use Retrieved Secrets in Your Pipeline:**
   - Secrets retrieved from Azure Key Vault are available as environment variables in the pipeline.
   - Example: If the secret name is `network-device-password`, it will be available as `$(network-device-password)`.

4. **Pass Secrets to Ansible Playbook:**
   - You can pass the retrieved secrets as environment variables to your Ansible playbook.
   - Example Ansible playbook usage:
     ```yaml
     - hosts: all
       vars:
         ansible_password: "{{ lookup('env', 'NETWORK_DEVICE_PASSWORD') }}"
       tasks:
         - name: Ensure the device is reachable
           ping:
     ```

### **3. Example Full Pipeline YAML**

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  # Add other variables if needed

stages:
- stage: Deploy
  jobs:
  - job: DeployJob
    steps:
    - task: AzureKeyVault@2
      inputs:
        azureSubscription: '<Your Service Connection Name>'
        KeyVaultName: '<Your Key Vault Name>'
        SecretsFilter: '*'
        RunAsPreJob: true

    - script: |
        echo "Running Ansible Playbook"
        ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
      env:
        NETWORK_DEVICE_PASSWORD: $(network-device-password)
```

### **Conclusion**

By integrating Azure Key Vault with your Azure DevOps pipeline, you ensure that sensitive information like passwords is securely managed and accessed. This approach improves the security and reliability of your automation processes by enabling machine-to-machine interactions without human intervention.
