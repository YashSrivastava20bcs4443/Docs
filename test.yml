Subject: Request for Server/User Creation and Software Installation for Network Device Backups

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to request the creation of a new server or a user account on an existing server to facilitate the backup of our network devices. This server will be dedicated to securely storing backups and managing configuration scripts.

To ensure seamless integration and operation, I kindly ask for the following requirements to be met:

Server/User Creation:

Please create a new server or a user account on an existing server with adequate storage capacity. Each backup file is approximately 3 to 4 KB in size, and we need to take backups for 14 firewalls daily. Kindly ensure that the main disk size is sufficient to accommodate these daily backups over an extended period.
Software Installation:

Install Ansible to automate the backup process and manage network device configurations.
Install the Expect module to handle automated interactions with the network devices during the backup process.
These tools are essential for the efficient and automated management of our network devices, ensuring that backups are conducted regularly and without manual intervention.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there are any formal procedures I need to follow to expedite this request.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
