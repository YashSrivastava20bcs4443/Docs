Slide 1: Title Slide
Project: Automated VM Deployment in Existing DR Infrastructure
🚀 Using Terraform & Azure DevOps Release Pipeline

Slide 2: Introduction
We are automating the creation of Virtual Machines (VMs) in an existing Disaster Recovery (DR) infrastructure using Terraform.
The process is integrated into an Azure DevOps Release Pipeline with manual approval before deployment.
Slide 3: Existing DR Infrastructure
Virtual Network (VNet)
Subnet (SNet)
Network Security Group (NSG)
Existing DR Policies and Setup
Slide 4: Terraform for VM Creation
We use Terraform to create VMs in the existing DR setup.
Terraform uses:
✅ Existing VNet & SNet
✅ Existing NSG for security policies
✅ Managed Disks & Availability Set (if required)
✅ Terraform VM Extension for post-creation software installation
Slide 5: VM Extension for Software Installation
After VM creation, we use Terraform VM Extensions to install:
✅ Required software (e.g., monitoring agents, security tools)
✅ Configuration scripts (e.g., PowerShell, Bash)
✅ Custom initialization settings
Slide 6: Azure DevOps Release Pipeline Workflow
📌 Trigger: Manual execution by the user
📌 Approval Stage: Needs manual approval before deployment
📌 Terraform Execution:
1️⃣ Terraform Init – Initialize backend state
2️⃣ Terraform Plan – Preview changes
3️⃣ Terraform Apply – Deploy resources
📌 Post-Deployment Tasks: Install software via VM Extension

Slide 8: Benefits of This Automation
🚀 Faster & Consistent VM Deployment
🔒 Security Compliance with DR Policies
💰 Cost & Time Savings via Automation
🛠️ Easy Software Installation via VM Extension
📊 Approval Process Ensures Control

Slide 9: Next Steps & Enhancements
🔹 Auto-Scaling Support in future updates
🔹 Infrastructure Monitoring Integration
🔹 Enhancing Security Policies via Terraform

Slide 10: Conclusion
✅ Automated, Secure, and Controlled VM Deployment
✅ Seamless Integration with Azure DevOps
✅ Approval-based Deployment Process
