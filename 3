Action Items:

1. Create an FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) for the firewall's IP address, which is required for the Ansible backup. This is necessary because displaying the IP address directly in the script violates the SOP.


2. Obtain CyberArk access for WinSCP to the specific folder named Network_Devices_Backup on the SFTP server.
