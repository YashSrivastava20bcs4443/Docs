Hello Sir, I am currently deploying a VM for disaster recovery (DR), where I also need to install Node Exporter, Windows, and other software on multiple VMs. I have stored the required software in a Blob container and am using Terraform VM extension to download it via FileURI and execute it using CMD. However, I am facing an issue where the container is not accessible, even though I have provided the SAS token. I am getting a 403 error.
