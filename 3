 If you don't want to use a SIP trunk, here are some alternative methods for bulk calling using Asterisk:


---

✅ 1. PRI (Primary Rate Interface) Line (Traditional Method)

Description: A physical telecommunication line (E1/T1) provided by telecom companies for bulk calling.

How it Works: Connect a PRI card (like Digium, Sangoma) to your Asterisk server.

Hardware Required: PRI card and physical connection from the telecom provider.

Pros:

No need for an internet connection.

Stable and reliable for large volumes.


Cons:

Requires physical hardware and installation.

Higher setup cost compared to SIP trunks.




---

✅ 2. GSM Gateway (SIM Card Based Calling)

Description: A GSM Gateway allows you to use physical SIM cards for making calls directly from Asterisk.

How it Works:

Insert a SIM card into the GSM Gateway device.

Connect the device to your Asterisk server using an IP network or USB.


Pros:

No dependency on the internet.

Suitable for limited bulk calls.


Cons:

Limited to the number of SIM card slots in the gateway.

May need multiple gateways for high-volume calling.

✅ 3. FXO Gateway (Landline Based Calling)

Description: FXO (Foreign Exchange Office) gateways allow Asterisk to connect to traditional analog landlines.

How it Works:

Plug your landline into the FXO gateway.

Connect the gateway to Asterisk via a network.


Pros:

No internet required.

Direct use of analog lines for calling.


Cons:

Limited by the number of landlines connected.

Slower for bulk testing compared to SIP and PRI.

✅ 4. WebRTC (Browser-Based Calling)

Description: WebRTC allows making calls directly through web browsers using Asterisk.

How it Works:

Configure WebRTC on Asterisk (pjsip module).

Use a web browser to initiate VoIP calls.


Pros:

No physical lines or cards required.

Easy to use and integrate with web apps.


Cons:

Dependent on internet connectivity.

Not ideal for large-scale bulk calling.

✅ 5. Softphones and VoIP Apps (No Hardware)

Description: Use Asterisk with softphones like Zoiper or Linphone for bulk calling.

How it Works:

Configure Asterisk with a VoIP account.

Use a softphone to dial numbers automatically.


Pros:

No hardware required.

Easy for small-scale testing.


Cons:

Requires internet for VoIP.

Limited for large-scale testing.

✅ Recommendation Based on Your Requirement (Open-Source + No SIP Trunk):

Small-Scale Testing: GSM Gateway or FXO Gateway.

Large-Scale Testing: PRI Line with a Digium card for bulk testing.
