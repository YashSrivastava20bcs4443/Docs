Subject: Request for Approval to Proceed with Access Setup for Network Devices Backup

Dear Abdul Hamed,

I hope you are doing well.

I would like to request your approval to proceed with setting up access to the Network_Devices_Backup folder on the SFTP server via CyberArk for WinSCP. This access is required for the following users:

Abdul Hamed

Yash Srivastava

Kushal Bisht

Rajeev Rana


Once approved, I will forward the request to the IAM team to complete the setup.

Please let me know if you require any additional information. Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,
Yash Srivastava
