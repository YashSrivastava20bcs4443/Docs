Slide 1: Title Slide
Project: Automated VM Deployment in Existing DR Infrastructure
🚀 Using Terraform & Azure DevOps Release Pipeline

Slide 2: Introduction
We have automated Virtual Machine (VM) deployments in an existing Disaster Recovery (DR) infrastructure using Terraform and Azure DevOps Release Pipeline.

✅ Golden Images are used for Linux & Windows VMs to ensure faster deployment and consistency.
✅ Image Management allows us to update Golden Images periodically with the latest software versions.
✅ Existing VMs that were created using older Golden Images are also updated to ensure they have the latest configurations and software.
✅ VM Extensions are used for post-deployment tasks when necessary.

Slide 3: Existing DR Infrastructure
Our DR environment includes:
✅ Virtual Network (VNet)
✅ Subnet (SNet)
✅ Network Security Group (NSG)
✅ Pre-configured DR Policies and Setup

Slide 4: Terraform for VM Deployment
Terraform provisions VMs using pre-built Golden Images, ensuring efficiency and consistency.

✅ Linux Golden Image includes:

node_exporter-1.9.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz (Monitoring)

SentinelAgent_linux_x86_64_v24_2_2_20.deb (Security)

NFS support via nfs-common installation

Additional users pre-configured

Firewall disabled for necessary configurations

✅ Windows Golden Image includes:

windows_exporter-0.26.1-amd64.msi (Monitoring)

wincollect-10.1.3-24.x64_6_3_(1).msi (Log Collection)

🚀 Golden Image Versioning Strategy:

New updates trigger the creation of a new Golden Image (Version 2, Version 3, etc.).

Existing VMs that were created using older Golden Images are updated first.

New VMs always use the latest Golden Image version automatically.

Slide 5: Golden Image Versioning & VM Updates
✅ Golden Image Versioning System

Golden Image V1 was used for previous VMs.

When new updates are available, we create Golden Image V2 with updated software.

New VMs will always use the latest version (V2, V3, etc.).

✅ Updating Existing VMs with Older Golden Images

Identify VMs that were created using Golden Image V1.

Apply updates using VM Extensions or direct software installations.

Ensure security patches and configurations match the latest version.

Once all VMs are updated, all deployments will shift to using Golden Image V2.

✅ New VMs Automatically Use the Latest Golden Image

Terraform ensures new VMs are deployed with the latest Golden Image version.

This eliminates the need for manual updates after deployment.

Slide 6: Azure DevOps Release Pipeline Workflow
📌 Trigger: Manually executed by the user
📌 Approval Stage: Requires manual approval from Abdul Hamed before deployment
📌 Terraform Execution:
1️⃣ Terraform Init – Initializes the backend state
2️⃣ Terraform Plan – Previews changes
3️⃣ Terraform Apply – Deploys VMs using Golden Images
📌 Post-Deployment Tasks:

Use VM Extension to install Sentinel security software on Windows VMs

Update old VMs that were created using older images
