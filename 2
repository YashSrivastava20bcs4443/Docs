Hereâ€™s an algorithm and flowchart for creating a Python script using Selenium to automate the described process.

Algorithm

1. Initialize Environment:

Install required libraries (Selenium, smtplib, etc.).

Configure the service account and download credentials for Google Analytics.



2. Login to Google Analytics:

Launch a browser using Selenium.

Navigate to the Google Analytics login page.

Log in using the service account credentials.



3. Navigate to Target Pages:

Specify the URLs of the respective Google Analytics pages where screenshots are needed.

Iterate over the list of URLs and navigate to each page.



4. Take Screenshots:

For each page, wait until the page loads completely.

Capture the screenshot and save it locally.



5. Send Email with Attachments:

Compose an email with the stakeholders' Teams channel email address as the recipient.

Attach the captured screenshots to the email.

Use an SMTP library to send the email.



6. Cleanup:

Close the browser and delete temporary files.
