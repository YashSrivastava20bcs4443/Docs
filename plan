**Subject: Pay for July 27-28 Weekend Work**

Dear [HR/Payroll Team],

I hope you are well.

I worked on July 27 and 28 (last weekend) and would like to inquire about the payout for those days. Could you please let me know when I can expect the payment?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
