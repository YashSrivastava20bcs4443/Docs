Here are the expanded benefits of each project:

    DR Drill-1: NJDC Disaster Recovery Setup in Azure: Ensures critical systems can be quickly restored during disasters or outages, minimizing downtime, data loss, and maintaining business continuity by leveraging cloud-based disaster recovery solutions.

    Li Office Network Q1: Enhances network infrastructure in the office, improving overall network speed, reliability, and security, leading to better performance, reduced downtime, and smoother business operations.

    Network Firewall Backup Automation (Q2): Automates the backup process for firewall configurations, ensuring that up-to-date backups are always available. This reduces manual intervention, accelerates recovery during incidents, and minimizes security risks.

    Network Firewall Configuration Automation: Automates the deployment and management of firewall configurations, reducing the potential for human error, ensuring consistency in network security policies, and improving overall security posture.

    Network Switch Backup Automation: Provides automated backups for network switches, ensuring quick restoration of settings in case of failures, improving network reliability, and reducing manual recovery efforts.

    Cloud Centralized Cost Dashboard (beta): Offers a single, centralized platform for tracking cloud costs, making it easier to monitor and analyze spending across cloud services, enabling better budgeting, cost optimization, and financial control.

    Cloud Centralized Event Box Dashboard (beta): Centralizes event monitoring across cloud infrastructure, improving visibility into system alerts and events, enabling faster response to issues, and enhancing overall system reliability and uptime.

    AI-based VM Capacity Forecasting (beta): Utilizes AI to predict future demand for virtual machine resources, allowing proactive resource allocation, preventing over-provisioning, and ensuring efficient use of cloud resources, thereby reducing costs.

    Compute/Storage Optimization: Optimizes the use of compute and storage resources across cloud infrastructure, leading to cost savings, better performance, and reduced waste of underutilized resources.
