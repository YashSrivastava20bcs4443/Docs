We Can Write RCA Rules for StackStorm

We can create custom RCA rules for StackStorm that will correlate alerts and identify the root cause. To do this effectively, we need some details about our infrastructure.

We Need the Following Details:

1. Which monitoring tools are being used?

(e.g., SolarWinds, SCOM, Kibana, ElasticSearch, AppInsight, etc.)



2. Which common alerts should be correlated in RCA?

(e.g., High CPU, Memory Spike, API Failures, Network Latency, Database Crash, etc.)



3. How should root cause mapping be done?

(e.g., "If 5 servers report high CPU usage along with API failures, the root cause might be CPU overload.")



4. Do we need automation or just an RCA report?

(e.g., "If disk space is full, automatically perform cleanup" or just send a Slack notification.)




If we share our monitoring setup and RCA requirements, we can create StackStorm rules that we can directly deploy for root cause analysis. ðŸš€
