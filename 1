Subject: Request for Staging Servers to Resolve Testing Challenges

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I would like to bring to your attention the challenges we have been facing due to the unavailability of the requested staging servers. This has significantly impacted our ability to perform proper testing of code and pipeline setups for our automation scripts.

As per standard practices, testing in a production environment is not feasible or advisable. To address this, it is essential to create a dedicated development environment for our tool, where we can safely and effectively test the automation scripts before deployment.

I kindly request your assistance in expediting the allocation or setup of the required staging servers to ensure seamless progress in our project.

Looking forward to your support and guidance.

Best regards,
Yash
