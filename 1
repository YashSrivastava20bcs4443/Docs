Epic 2: TFN-IVR Performance Matrix Dashboard


---

User Story 1: Frontend Development for Contact Center Monitoring Website

Description: Develop a responsive web interface that mimics a contact center dashboard, displaying key call center metrics and agent statuses.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. The UI displays key metrics (e.g., active calls, queue times, agent status) in real time.


2. The website is responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.


3. Role-based access controls are implemented for different user types (e.g., managers, agents).


4. User interactions (e.g., filtering, searching, and report generation) function smoothly with appropriate loading states and error handling.

User Story 2: Backend API for Data Aggregation and Management

Description: Build the backend services that aggregate data from various call center sources, process it, and expose RESTful APIs for the frontend and Kibana integration.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. RESTful endpoints are created to serve call metrics and agent status data in JSON format.


2. The backend supports secure data retrieval with proper authentication and authorization.


3. Data aggregation processes (e.g., collecting call logs, processing performance metrics) run automatically on a set schedule or in real time.


4. The API can handle high volumes of requests without significant performance degradation.

User Story 3: Integration with Kibana for Real-Time Data Visualization

Description: Connect the backend data pipelines with Kibana to visualize real-time call performance metrics and system health, and embed or link these dashboards within the website.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. Automated pipelines push the processed call center data to Kibana in real time.


2. Kibana dashboards are configured to display key metrics such as call volumes, average handling time, and agent performance.


3. The integration allows users to filter and drill down into specific data points directly from the website.


4. The embedded or linked Kibana dashboards update without requiring a page refresh and maintain synchronization with the backend data.
