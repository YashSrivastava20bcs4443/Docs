Here’s a clear mapping table for the suggested fields used in mapped_data, based on the sample raw Splunk alert you provided:

Mapped Field	Key in Raw Splunk Alert	Example Value	Notes

EventLevel	severity	Critical	Taken directly from raw alert (Critical) — no hardcoding.
EventStatus	status	anomalous	Optional fallback to statusExtended if needed.
EventTitle	messageTitle	Critical Alert: Real Browser Detector	Human-readable title of the event.
EventBlob	Full JSON blob	{...}	Entire original raw event data (used as backup/reference).
EventTimestamp	timestamp	2025-05-19T20:53:00.000Z	Original event occurrence time (not ingestion time).
@timestamp	Generated in script	Current UTC timestamp when mapping is processed.	Used for indexing freshness.
EventSource	detector	Real Browser Detector	The alerting rule or tool that generated the alert.
EventNode	dimensions.location	AWS LZ - Los Angeles	Location from where the alert originated.
EventInstance	dimensions.test	[COA.com-Desktop] STA Vacations[ Flights+ Car]	Specific instance or test name.
EventValue	inputs.stream.value	0.0	The actual metric or signal value that triggered the alert.
EventResource	originatingMetric	synthetics.run.uptime.percent	The metric/resource involved.
EventMatchID	incidentId	GrTVuYuA4AE	Unique ID that ties to the alert/incident in Splunk/SignalFx.


Let me know if you want to enrich any of these fields (e.g., resolve detectorUrl to a clickable link or add derived tags).
