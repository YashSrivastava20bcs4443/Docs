The error message indicates a misconfiguration related to authentication tokens, often used in Single Sign-On (SSO) or OAuth-based systems. Here’s how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

Steps to Fix "No Token" Issue During Login

1. Verify Application Configuration

Check the authentication settings in your application's configuration file.

Ensure that the following details are correctly configured:

Client ID and Secret: Ensure they match the values provided by the identity provider (IdP).

Redirect URI: Ensure it matches the value configured in the IdP.

Token Endpoint: Verify that the correct endpoint URL is being used to obtain tokens.



2. Inspect the Logs

Check the application or server logs for more details about the error.

Look for authentication or token-related errors.


For Nginx logs, run:

sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log


3. Check Identity Provider (IdP) Configuration

If using SSO (e.g., Azure AD, Okta, etc.):

Verify that the application is registered correctly in the IdP.

Ensure that the allowed callback/redirect URI matches what the application sends.


Ensure the token endpoint is functioning properly. Test it using tools like Postman or curl.


4. Token Expiration or Generation Issues

Ensure the token is being requested and generated correctly:

Confirm that the Authorization header is included in requests where necessary.

Check if the token expiration settings are configured correctly.


If a token is being reused, verify that it hasn’t expired.


5. Ensure HTTPS is Used

Many IdPs and token services require HTTPS. Ensure the application is accessed over HTTPS.


6. Browser or Cache Issue

Clear your browser cache and cookies or try logging in with a different browser.

Verify that your browser settings are not blocking cookies or tokens.


7. Debug the Authentication Flow

Enable detailed logging for the authentication library or middleware in use.

Use browser developer tools to trace requests:

Check if the token is being passed back after login.

Look for errors in the network tab.



8. Correct Nginx Proxy Settings

If Nginx is acting as a reverse proxy, ensure it passes authentication headers correctly:

location / {
    proxy_pass http://backend;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header Authorization $http_authorization;
}


9. Contact Admin or Support

If you don’t have access to debug configurations, contact the system administrator or support team to check the application and IdP settings.

Key Focus Points

Authentication relies on correct token exchange between the client, server, and IdP.

Ensure all configurations align (redirect URIs, client secrets, token endpoints).

Debug network requests and application logs for clues.
