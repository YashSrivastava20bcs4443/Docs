An open-source event correlation engine can help you analyze and correlate logs, alerts, and events from various sources within your environment. Here are some notable options:

1. Simple Event Correlator (SEC): SEC is a lightweight, platform-independent tool written in Perl. It's designed for advanced event processing and can be utilized for event log monitoring, network and security management, and fraud detection. SEC processes event streams to detect and act on specific event patterns within predefined time windows. 

2. Dsiem: Dsiem is a security event correlation engine tailored for the ELK stack, enabling it to function as a comprehensive SIEM system. It offers OSSIM-style correlation for normalized logs and events, integrates threat intelligence and vulnerability information, and generates risk-adjusted alarms. 

3. Cortex: Developed by Myntra, Cortex is a fault-tolerant events correlation engine that groups and correlates incoming events to facilitate actions such as creating or resolving incidents and conducting root cause analysis. 

4. Sagan: Sagan is a multi-threaded, high-performance, real-time log analysis and correlation engine. Written in C, it operates on Unix-like systems and is designed to provide real-time alerting and correlation with compatibility to Snort or Suricata rule management software. 

5. Prelude SIEM: Prelude is a Security Information and Event Management system that collects and centralizes IT security information, offering real-time alerts about intrusions and security threats. It supports multiple tools for forensic reporting on big data and smart data to identify weak signals and advanced persistent threats. 

When selecting an event correlation engine, consider factors such as integration capabilities with your existing systems, scalability, performance requirements, and the specific features that align with your organization's needs.
