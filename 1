Approach
Data Preparation:

Ensure the dataset includes the following fields:
Timestamp (@timestamp)
Event Source (e.g., server, application, network device)
Event Type (e.g., server down, application issue, network timeout)
Event Severity (e.g., Critical, Warning)
Event Dependencies (Define known dependencies, such as which application runs on which server).
Correlation Logic:

Sort events by timestamp.
Use a dependency map that defines relationships (e.g., Server → Application → Network).
Group events into "correlation windows" based on time intervals.
For each window:
Identify a root cause (e.g., server down).
Aggregate dependent alerts (e.g., alerts from applications or devices connected to the server).
Implementation:

Create a function to find root causes and related alerts.
Generate a timeline or visualization to show the hierarchy of alerts.


Key Features in the Code:
Dependency Map:

Defines relationships between systems (e.g., servers, apps, databases).
Uses a directed graph to trace dependencies.
Correlation Logic:

Groups alerts based on timestamps and dependencies.
Identifies the root cause (e.g., server down) and matches dependent alerts.
Result:

Produces a structured output showing the root cause and related alerts.
