AnalysisTime EfficiencyTraditional Method: ~7.25-8.25 hours leverages high parallelism (100 VMs, 7 DPs, scalable Ansible), but software installation adds overhead.Golden Image Method: ~7-7.25 hours is slightly faster (~0.25-1 hour savings) due to no post-creation steps.Cost SavingsTraditional: Higher runtime (~8 hours) increases compute costs for VM uptime during installation (e.g., $0.096/hour for Standard_D2s_v3 × 1,200 × 8 = ~$921.60). SCCM and Ansible on-premises reduce cloud costs but require maintenance.Golden Image: Shorter runtime (~7 hours, $806.40) and pre-baked software lower compute costs. Initial image creation ($1-2 per image) is negligible.StandardizationTraditional: Variable outcomes due to post-deployment configuration; SCCM/Ansible errors could lead to inconsistencies.Golden Image: Ensures uniform VMs, enhancing reliability and compliance.FeasibilityTraditional: Feasible with existing on-premises SCCM (7 DPs) and Ansible server, but network latency to Azure may slow deployment.Golden Image: Requires initial effort (~1 hour total prep) but simplifies cloud-native scaling.
