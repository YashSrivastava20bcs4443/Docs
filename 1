To create a flowchart based on the compliance check process outlined, I will provide a visual representation with the following key elements:

1. Start Process


2. Load Server List (Excel file)


3. Iterate Over Each Server


4. Check Compliance Parameters (for both Windows and Linux)

OS Check

SentinelOne Status

Logging Status

Security Patches

NTP Configuration

Service Status



5. Generate Automated Report


6. Manual Report Validation


7. Highlight Gaps/Non-Compliance


8. End Process



I'll generate a flowchart based on these steps.
