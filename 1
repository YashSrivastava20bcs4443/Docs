Subject: Approaches for Integrating Python Script with Prometheus and Grafana

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I wanted to update you on two possible approaches for integrating our Python script data into Prometheus and visualizing it on Grafana:

Approach 1: JSON Dump + Prometheus Integration

The Python script fetches data and dumps it into a JSON file every 15 minutes.

A separate script reads the JSON file and exposes the metrics in Prometheus format.

Pros: Backup of historical data, clear separation of data fetching and Prometheus exposure.

Cons: Slightly more complex due to two scripts.


Approach 2: Direct Data Exposure to Prometheus

The Python script directly fetches data and updates Prometheus metrics in real-time during its execution.

Pros: Single script, no intermediate storage required.

Cons: No historical backup if the script fails.


Let me know which approach youâ€™d prefer, or if you'd like a further discussion.

Best regards,
Yash
