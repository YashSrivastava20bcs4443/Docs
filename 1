Here is the diagram representing the process your code follows, as requested. Let me summarize the steps of the process:

Start:

The process begins with setting up the environment, including preparing dependencies like ChromeDriver and initializing the Selenium WebDriver.
Selenium Web Driver Initialization:

The Selenium WebDriver is initialized to allow interaction with a website.
ChromeDriver Setup:

ChromeDriver is configured to work with the installed version of Google Chrome on the machine.
Sign-In to Website:

Using Selenium, the script performs a login by inputting credentials, handling any pop-ups during sign-in.
Zoom Adjustment & Screenshot Capture:

The zoom level is adjusted for better visibility, and screenshots are taken at various stages.
API Data Fetching:

API requests are sent to gather capacity data (free space, used space, etc.) from a Dell EMC Unity system.
Email Composition:

The screenshots and API data are combined and formatted to create a detailed email with inline images and structured data.
Send Email via SMTP:

The email is sent through an SMTP server (in this case, an Outlook server), including all the screenshots and data.
Pipeline Execution in Azure DevOps:

The process is then executed in an Azure DevOps pipeline, automating the full end-to-end process, including error handling and cleanup. If any issues occur, the errors are captured, and the necessary corrective actions are taken.
The diagram visually represents these steps along with error handling and system cleanup mechanisms.
