Change Request Description:

We are implementing VNet peering between the Cloud DR site and the Hub site to establish seamless network connectivity, enabling secure communication between resources in both VNets. This will allow better failover support and optimized traffic routing between the disaster recovery infrastructure and the central hub network.

Scope of Work:

Configure VNet peering between the Cloud DR site and the Hub site.

Ensure bidirectional communication is established as per the defined network policies.

Validate connectivity post-implementation to confirm successful peering.

Monitor network traffic for any anomalies after the change.


Rollback Plan:

If any unexpected issues arise, we will delete the VNet peering configuration to revert the network setup to its original state.
