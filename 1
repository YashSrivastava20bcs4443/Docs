StackStorm has predefined rules and workflows, but they are not tailored for specific environments. It is an event-driven automation tool where you can write custom rules to correlate alerts from monitoring tools like SolarWinds, SCOM, Kibana, Elastic, etc.

Does StackStorm have predefined RCA rules?

❌ No, it does not provide predefined RCA rules.
✅ However, it does offer predefined packs and integrations that help in setting up RCA.

Predefined Features Useful for RCA:

1. Monitoring Integrations:
StackStorm provides integrations with SolarWinds, Nagios, ElasticSearch, Kibana, etc., allowing alerts to be brought into StackStorm.


2. Event Correlation Engine:
StackStorm's rules engine has the capability to correlate multiple alerts, but you need to write the correlation rules yourself.


3. Predefined Packs:
Automation packs for Slack, PagerDuty, Nagios, AWS, Azure, etc., are available.
You can install them using the st2 pack install command.



Do I need to write RCA rules myself?

Yes, because RCA logic is infrastructure-specific. StackStorm provides a framework with predefined integrations and workflows, but you need to define RCA logic based on your alerts and infrastructure.

If you are looking for a fully predefined RCA engine, you can explore AI-based event correlation tools like Moogsoft or BigPanda, but they are not free.
