Objective

The objective of the Contact Center Dashboard is to provide real-time visibility and historical insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) of the call center, including total calls, answered calls, abandoned calls, IVR routing data, and TFN-wise metrics. The dashboard is designed to help operations teams monitor performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to optimize customer interactions.


---

Background

The data powering this dashboard is sourced directly from the NICE inContact API, which serves as the backend integration point for retrieving call center activity. This API provides comprehensive access to call logs, agent performance metrics, IVR flow details, and TFN-based call routing statistics. These data points are extracted, transformed, and displayed through an internal web-based dashboard accessible on the Fareportal company network, eliminating the need for user login and enabling seamless access for authorized personnel.
