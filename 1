Monitoring a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster involves observing both the cluster itself (infrastructure-level metrics) and the workloads running inside the cluster (application-level metrics). Hereâ€™s a categorized list of what you can monitor:


---

1. Cluster-Level Monitoring

Focuses on the health and performance of the cluster infrastructure.

a. Node Metrics

CPU usage (utilization and throttling).

Memory usage (total and available).

Disk I/O (read/write rates, disk space).

Network I/O (throughput, errors, latency).

Node availability (status: Ready, NotReady).

Pod capacity (number of running vs. allocatable Pods).


b. Cluster Resources

API server metrics (latency, request rates, error rates).

Cluster health (etcd health and performance metrics).

Resource allocation (cluster resource usage vs. capacity).

Scheduler performance (scheduling latency and failures).

Controller metrics (e.g., replication controller errors).


c. Persistent Storage

Volume health (availability, provisioning errors).

Disk pressure (on nodes or volumes).


d. Network

Service discovery (DNS errors or latency).

Network policies (compliance and rules).

Pod-to-Pod connectivity (packet loss, latency).



---

2. Inside-the-Cluster Monitoring

Focuses on workloads and applications running in the cluster.

a. Pod and Container Metrics

Pod status (running, pending, failed).

Container CPU and memory usage.

Container restarts and crash loops.

Container log errors or anomalies.


b. Workload Performance

Deployment status (desired vs. current replicas).

Job completion (success/failure of CronJobs or Jobs).

StatefulSet health (pod readiness, scaling issues).


c. Application Metrics

Request rates (e.g., HTTP requests per second).

Error rates (e.g., 4xx, 5xx).

Latency (response times).

Custom application metrics (via Prometheus or similar tools).


d. Networking

Ingress traffic (latency, bandwidth, errors).

Service metrics (availability, traffic distribution).

Load balancer metrics.


e. Logs

Application logs (log patterns, errors).

System logs (Kubelet, kube-proxy, etc.).


f. Security and Compliance

RBAC configuration issues.

Image vulnerabilities (e.g., scanning container images).

Pod security policies (non-compliance checks).

3. Monitoring Tools Integration

Prometheus/Grafana: For metrics collection and visualization.

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): For log monitoring.

Kubernetes Dashboard: For a high-level cluster overview.

Jaeger/Zipkin: For distributed tracing of applications.

Tools like Lens, Datadog, or Dynatrace: For enhanced observability.
