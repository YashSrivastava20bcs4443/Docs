This Week:

Completed pipeline creation for Dell Unisphere screenshot automation. However, a bug is preventing it from functioning correctly, and I am actively troubleshooting this issue.

Progressing on the second phase of the network automation project, focused on creating an Ansible backup script for switch backups.

The Ansible script for Cisco IOS switches is written, and I am currently in the process of testing it.


Next Week:

Continue resolving the pipeline bug for Dell Unisphere screenshot automation.

Test the Ansible script in the development environment and validate the switch backup process.

Set up a pipeline for the switch backup project.

Document the entire switch backup process.
